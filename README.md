# Deck of Cards Coding Exercise
This repository uses the https://deckofcardsapi.com/ API to create and shuffle a deck of cards, prints the user's hand to the console, and then prints the highest scoring poker hand that the cards fulfill to the console.

Requirements: You need to have node.js downloaded and installed. You can download it here https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Click Windows Installer or macOS Installer depending on your system.

Steps to get the program running:
  Download the three .js files from the repository and save them to your main drive directory (Windows is usually the C:\ Drive):
    main.js
    pokerHandCalculator.js
    testPokerHandCalculator.js
  Open the Command Prompt
  cd into the Deck of Cards folder
    cd
